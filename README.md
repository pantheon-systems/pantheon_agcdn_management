The UI provides a way to do the following tasks:

* Full Purge of AGCDN - This is for all domains and URLs attached to the site. Applicable for customers with Image Optimization

* Search and Edit Dictionaries - With varying purpose and function, we create Dictionaries that lets customer maintain these keys and values. Usual use cases are Redirects, Geo-blocklist and so on
